# CutoutViewIndicator-Demo

A simple Android application to show off the features of fuzz-productions/CutoutViewIndicator

The app in use:

![An Android device screen, its background a light blue. Near the top 
lies a dark blue ViewPager - just 20 dp below it is a row of narrow
rectangles, all but one of which are dark blue too. One of these
rectangles, however, is orange. As the animated gif plays, we see
the ViewPager page to new views. The orange bar underneath reliably
indicates exactly which page is currently showing, mimicking the
slightest perturbation in the ViewPager](http://i.imgur.com/fKOez3z.gif)
